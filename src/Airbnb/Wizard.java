/**
 * There are 10 wizards, 0-9, you are given a list that each entry is a list of wizards known by wizard.
 * Define the cost between wizards and wizard[j] as square of different of i and j. To find the min cost between 0 and 9.
 *
 * Dijkstra, similar to CheapestFlightsWithKStops
 *
 *
 * 0-9 represent 10 islands
 * each island has one way bridge connecting to other islands, e.g.
 *
 * 0ï¼š [1, 3, 5],
 * 1:   [2, 4],
 * ...
 * 9: [3]
 *
 * cost is square of diff of island number: island0- island2 (2-0)^2 = 4
 * find min cost from 0 to 9
